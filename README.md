### Hi there! I'm Serdar Annayev 👋

I am a **Computer Programming** student at **Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University** [1], bridging the gap between hardware and software. With a background in **Electrical-Electronics & Panel Design** [2], I have a strong foundation in system logic, which I now apply to full-stack development.

My experience ranges from industrial automation documentation at **Sütrak Klima** [3] to leading a **TÜBİTAK** project focused on environmental awareness [4]. Currently, I am focused on building scalable backend systems and e-commerce solutions.
